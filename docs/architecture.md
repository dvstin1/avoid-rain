# Application Architecture & Lifecycle

This document outlines the high-level execution flow and the main entry point's structural requirements.

## 1. main.py Structural Skeleton
To ensure a clean exit on Debian Linux and prevent orphaned processes, `main.py` must follow this lifecycle pattern:

```python
import pygame
import sys
from constants import *
from engine.game_state import GameState
from rendering.renderer import Renderer

def main():
    # 1. Initialization
    pygame.init()
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))
    clock = pygame.time.Clock()
    
    state = GameState()
    renderer = Renderer(screen)
    
    running = True
    
    try:
        # 2. Main Game Loop
        while running:
            # a. Calculate Delta Time (dt)
            dt = clock.tick(FPS) / 1000.0
            
            # b. Event Handling (Discrete Input)
            for event in pygame.event.get():
                if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                    running = False
                if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                    if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
                        running = False
                    # Pass other discrete actions to engine
            
            # c. Polling (Continuous Input)
            # Pass keys to engine for movement
            
            # d. Update Engine Logic
            # state.update(dt, actions)
            
            # e. Rendering
            # renderer.render(state)
            
    finally:
        # 3. Clean Exit Routine
        # This block executes even if the loop is broken by an error
        pygame.quit()
        sys.exit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## 2. Key Lifecycle Rules
- **Resource Management:** All Pygame surfaces and sound channels must be initialized within the `main()` scope or managed by a dedicated loader that is called within the `try` block.
- **Error Handling:** The `finally` block is mandatory to ensure the terminal state of the Debian environment remains clean.
- **FPS Capping:** The loop must be capped (defaulting to 60 FPS) to prevent excessive CPU usage, while still providing `dt` for frame-rate independence.
